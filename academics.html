      <h1> My Academic Qualifications</h1>
      <div class = "myacademics">
        <p> I went to Mount Saint Dominic Academy in New Jersey for high school where I played varsity Lacrosse and Tennis. I was a part of the National Honors Society, Stock Market Club, and was co-found and president of Habitat for Humanity. When I graduated high school, the next stop of my journey was at the Univetsity of Michigan where I am currently a sophomore. I am in the School of Information with a path in User Experience. I have sufficient experience in C++, python, CSS, and HTML. Alongside classes, I am a member of and on the Programming Council for the Alpha Gamma chapter of Zeta Tau Alpha. I am a member in Kid’s Kitche, Habitat for Humanity, and the Women’s Network. College life is busy and stressful.
