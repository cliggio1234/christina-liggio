      <h1> My Advice to Busy College Students Who are Trying to be Their Best Selves</h1>
      <h3>1) Get Sufficient Sleep</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>This is hard to do sometimes with everything going on, but it is something that should be prioritized. For your brain to function properly and for your body to have enough energy to get up and move you must get good sleep. If you are not getting enough sleep, use baby steps and add 10-20 minutes on to each night. </li>
      </ul>
      <h3> 2) Clear Your Mind in the Mornings and Nights</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>I have recently started doing 10-20 minutes of yoga everymorning. It wakes me up and gets my mind and body ready for the day ahead of me. I have noticed a drastic change in my productivity and mood! Another option is to journal first thing in the morning! I did this for a while but have noticed that the movement and stretching of yoga has been more helpful for me. However, I still love to journal at night before I go to bed. I list all the good things that happened in the day and what I could have changed to make it better. This exercises my gratitude and clears my mind for a deep sleep.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3> 3) Plan Out Your Days </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>I cannot emphasize this enough. It holds yourself accountable and keeps a strong routine. Thinking about everything I have to do in a day can be very overwhelming and stresses me out. There have been days when I think about everything I have to do instead of actually doing it. Writing everything down in a schedule makes it appear much more doable and makes me ready to crush my day and cross everything over rather than run away from it. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3> 4) Add Movement to Your Day</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>As well as planning out your school and work schedule it is very important to plan out your workout schedule as well. Whether you are planning an hour long intense workout class or a 20 minute at home no-equitment workout, write it down and schedule it! Working out is a great way to space out your day and give you some energy. If you do not feel like a big structured workout, a walk or stretching is a great way to get the blood flowing. Sometimes when my brain is tired from staring at my computer, I get up and do a few headstands and then feel better to do more work! If I have more time, I love to go on a walk outside with friends.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3> 5) Find a Support System</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>One of the best ways to keep yourself accountable is to have workout buddies! Whether you guys actually workout together or you just  talk about it, it is a huge motivator and keeps things fun! There are so many amazing online communities as well.</li>
